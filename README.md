# Deep Learning Specialization (DLspec)

This repo takes the code from the deeplearning.ai Deep Learning specialization and puts 
them into python files that I will then use to develop separate notebooks to strengthen 
my understanding of the learnings from the specialization.

This is an ongoing project. I am currently completing course 1 of 5 courses.
